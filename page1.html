                        There are several reasons. First, medical researchers have shown that secondhand smoke, that is,<br> the smoke from other people's cigarettes,
                         causes cancer and other health problems.<br> If the smoke were car exhaust or burning trash,

                                        about every day hard work and about thriving on a challenge. It's about embracing the pain that you'll

                                             stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I lived through this horror.
